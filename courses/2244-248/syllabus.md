### Course Text

- K. H. Rosen. *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications*, 8th ed. McGraw-Hill, 2019.

### Activities

- Class Participation

  The lectures are for your benefit. You should ask questions when you have them. I am
  more than happy to answer your questions relating to the course material.

- Office Hours

  Office hours are for your benefit. I am more than happy to answer any questions that
  you may have relating to the course material.

- Note Taking

  You will sign up for one lecture to be a note taker for the class. You will take
  detailed lecture notes, type them up in LaTeX and post the pdf to Canvas by 6pm on the
  day after the lecture. Your notes will be graded for correctness.

  Sign up for a date from the link in the Canvas discussion.

- Homework

  Homework will be assigned weekly and collected at the beginning of class on the due
  date. A couple problems will be graded for correctness, and the remainder for
  completion.

### Students with Disabilities

It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable
accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to
participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Use of Disability
Resource Center (DRC) services, including testing accommodations, requires prior
authorization by the DRC and compliance with approved procedures.

You are encouraged to contact the DRC at (805) 756 1395 (or via email at
<drc@calpoly.edu>) as early as possible in the term and reach out to me by email or
during office hours to discuss your individual needs for accommodations.

### Collaboration and Honor Code

Please do work together on homework. Not only do I allow this, I suggest and encourage
it.

*Do not* work together on written exams.

Cheating will result, at a minimum, in an F for the project or exam to all students
involved. In severe cases, all students involved will immediately receive an F in the
course. This will also result in a report to the Office of Student Rights &
Responsibilities. See <https://osrr.calpoly.edu/academic-integrity> for more information.

### COVID-19 Compliance, Classroom, and Campus Safety

By participating in this course, you agree to abide by all campus safety protocols.
Please note that safety protocols may change throughout the quarter. You must follow
**all** protocols as outlined in the most recent campus updates.
