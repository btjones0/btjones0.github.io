# Course Syllabus

## CSC 101: Fundamentals of Computer Science

### Course Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of algorithmic problem solving.
- Apply top-down design, stepwise refinement, and procedural abstraction.
- Use basic control constructs and data types to solve problems.
- Lastly, exposure to the Python programming language.

### Course Text

The course textbook is [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (2nd
Edition)](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e) by Downey. Available free online.

### Activities

- Reading

  Reading will be assigned out of the course text daily to be read by the next class
  meeting. I will not be testing you on material from the reading directly, but the
  reading is an excellent additional source of instruction. If you "learn by reading",
  then make sure you follow along in the book.

- Class Participation

  The lectures are for your benefit. You should ask questions when you have them. I am
  more than happy to answer your questions relating to the course material.

- Office Hours

  Office hours are for your benefit. I am happy to answer any course-related questions or
  to help with any programming issues you may have. An important part of the learning
  process is encountering difficulty, struggling, and solving problems. Make sure you
  have at least tried to solve the problem with which you are coming to me.

- Queries

  Two to four students will be drawn randomly for a query at the beginning of most
  classes.

- Labs

  There are 9 planned lab assignments (exact number is subject to change). Each lab
  assignment must be submitted to GitHub by the due date. It is your responsibility to
  complete all of the lab submission requirements. No late labs will be accepted.

  You are allowed and encouraged to work together on lab assignments.

  For most labs, you will be given a basic set of test cases with which to test your
  code. You are expected to add to those test cases to thoroughly test your own code.
  Once handed in, I will test your code with my own rigorous set of test cases and your
  grade will be determined by how many tests your code passes.

  Once you have completed the lab assignment, you are encouraged to use the remaining lab
  time to work on your programming projects. Understand that programming projects must be
  done alone.

- Projects

  There will be five programming assignments (exact number is subject to change). These
  assignments are intended to be of greater length and complexity than the lab
  assignments.

  *Projects must be completed individually. **Collaboration on projects is not
  permitted.** Students who collaborate on projects will fail the class and be reported
  to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR).*

  Programming assignments will be submitted via GitHub. Except for extreme situations,
  late assignments will not be accepted for full credit.

  At a minimum, programming assignments must run to be considered for grading. If a
  submitted program does not run, you will receive a zero for that assignment.

  As with labs, for most projects, you will be given a basic set of test cases with which
  to test your code. You are expected to add to those test cases to thoroughly test your
  own code. Once handed in, I will test your code with my own rigorous set of test cases
  and your grade will be determined by how many tests your code passes.

  *Late Projects*: You may submit/resubmit your code for projects late for a maximum
  grade of 70%. The due date for late/resubmissions will vary by project, but generally
  it will be about 2 days after the original due date.

- Exams

  There will be two midterm exams and one final exam. The exams will cover concepts
  presented in the lectures and material based on the labs and programming assignments.
  The exams will be closed book and closed note.

### Grading

Exact grade breakdown is subject to change pending accurate number of labs and projects.

| Graded Item | % total |
|-------------|---------|
| Queries     | 5%      |
| Labs        | 15%     |
| Projects    | 30%     |
| Midterm 1   | 15%     |
| Midterm 2   | 15%     |
| Final       | 20%     |

### Students with Disabilities

It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable
accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to
participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Use of Disability
Resource Center (DRC) services, including testing accommodations, requires prior
authorization by the DRC and compliance with approved procedures.

You are encouraged to contact the DRC at (805) 756 1395 (or via email at
<drc@calpoly.edu>) as early as possible in the term and reach out to me by email or
during office hours to discuss your individual needs for accommodations.

### Collaboration and Honor Code

Please do work together on labs. Not only do I allow this, I suggest and encourage it.

*Do not* work together on anything else. Programming assignments and exams are individual
works. Collaboration includes, but is not limited to:

- Copying even a single line of another student's code or of code found online
- Reading, writing, or discussing any part of another student's code
- Transferring, publishing, or otherwise distributing your code to other students

Cheating will result, at a minimum, in an F for the project or exam to all students
involved. In severe cases, all students involved will immediately receive an F in the
course. This will also result in a report to the Office of Student Rights &
Responsibilities. See <https://osrr.calpoly.edu/academic-integrity> for more information.

### COVID-19 Compliance, Classroom, and Campus Safety

By participating in this course, you agree to abide by all campus safety protocols.
Please note that safety protocols may change throughout the quarter. You must follow
**all** protocols as outlined in the most recent campus updates.
