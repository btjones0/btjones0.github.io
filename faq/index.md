# FAQ (or at least AQ)

## Fall 2025

- CSC 349

  > On average how much time should we spend working by ourselves before we ask you for
  > help?

  There's not necessarily a hard limit here, but at least try for a little bit. That
  said, don't leave yourself stuck on something for a long time. You should ask me
  questions when you have them.

  > cats or dogs and any videos you recommend for this course CSC 349?

  Probably dogs.

  And I don't have anything that comes to mind, feel free to ask on EdStem for resources
  for specific topics if you have any questions.

  > As a transfer student, is there anything specific that I should make sure that I

  Inductive proofs is a big one. And really the main one. And please ask me questions if
  there's any background that I'm assuming that I shouldn't be.

  There are videos linked in the schedule for about the first week that you might find
  useful.

## Summer 2025

- CSC 445

  > How can I improve my chances of success this quarter? What content can I prepare for
  > ahead of time by starting to learn about it now?

  I would make sure to stay on top of the homework and ask questions when you have them!

  I don't know that preparing in advance is necessary, but we will be following fairly
  closely with the textbook, so feel free to read ahead. I'd be happy to say what
  sections are relevant at any given time.

  > What are you doing this summer besides CSC-445?

  Not a whole lot. Occasional hiking and a fair amount of reading. Other than that,
  mostly relaxing.

## Spring 2025

- CSC 232

  > What videos should we watch if we are beginners?

  I don't really have any suggestions here. The class itself is intended for beginners,
  so you'll be in good company.

  > How will quizzes be formatted (will we be writing code)?

  A mix of reading code and figuring out what it does and writing code to do a desired
  task.

  > Are there any apps that are good to test out my code?

  I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for, but we will be writing tests for our
  code.

  > Panda, polar, brown, black, grizzly, or koala bear?

  Panda.

  > What is your policy on late work?

  Generally not accepted without a reason.

  > Is there any extra credit offered for this course?

  I don't have any planned.

  > How would you describe the workload?

  The official Cal Poly policy would be that you should be spending about 5 hours per
  week on this course (outside of class time). This should be more than enough time to
  do the assignments and to study.

## Winter 2025

- CSC 430

  > What's your background?

  I have a bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics from Cal Poly. While here, I
  got a minor in computer science.

  > Recommended study time for this course?

  You're probably asking about duration not time of day, but I'll answer both! For time
  of day, I'd recommend before 10 pm. I don't think good studying typically happens
  after 10 pm. I would strongly advise against trying to stay up all night studying.

  For duration, Cal Poly suggests you should be spending 6 hours per week outside of
  class time working on this class. That should account for assignments and for other
  studying.

  > If you need help with the class, what are the next best options after going to
  > office hours?

  There's also lab time and EdStem. Lab time and office hours would be my strongest
  suggestion.

  > Do you have any other tips on practicing the AST or concrete syntax for the quizzes?

  Writing a lot of good tests for every assignment 3 and onward. Lab 6 will also
  (hopefully) help.

  > What is the most troublesome portion of the course?

  I'm probably the wrong person to ask this question as it's quite subjective (and my
  opinions are probably different from what yours well end up being). So, rather than
  answer it, I'll answer a slightly different question. Rather than "most troublesome",
  I'll say what I think is the "most important" assignment(s) to do well on.

  The (in my opinion) most important assignments to do well on are 3 and 4. The
  assignments after assignment 4 all build on assignment 4. You'll want to make sure
  that your assignment 4 ends up in a good state.

  > Do you play chess?

  I know the rules, I don't really play.

  > Partner projects vs individual: is there any differences in the project for
  > individual vs group project?

  They are the same projects, just with an optional partner.

## Spring 2024

- CSC 248

  > What kind of material should I expect to learn from class? Will it be structured
  > like a typical math class with weekly HW problems, etc?

  We're going to be learning the idea of mathematical proof and then some fundamental
  ideas of mathematics as they apply to computer science, for example: sets, functions,
  recurrence relations, big-O notations, combinatorics, graphs, etc.

  We will have weekly homework and weekly quizzes, see the syllabus for details.

- CSC 430

  > How much can we utilize the functions and features not covered in class if we find
  > them online?

  Generally that's fine. If you're not sure, ask me.

## Winter 2024

- CSC 430

  > Are we going to be working solo, as partners, or in groups?

  Either solo or with a partner (of your choosing if you desire). More on that soon.

  > How many hours do you expect us to take on the labs and projects?

  Labs are relatively short and can probably be done entirely during lab time. Projects
  are a fair bit longer, although it tends to vary greatly from student to student. I
  would suggest starting early.

## Fall 2023

- CSC 430

  > What is your favorite movie or show?

  Probably Blazing Saddles.

  > What's your favorite book?

  Probably The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson.

  > Why did we not get a classroom in the new Frost center? Are we not special enough?

  Most of the building is reserved lab space. I believe the only general purpose lecture
  rooms are for very large lectures (e.g., my CSC 445 section this quarter has 100
  students and is in 181-102).

  > Why must we use Racket?

  A big reason is that it's an example of a functional programming language, probably
  something fairly different from many of the languages that you've seen before. Several
  of the assignments we will be doing would be considerably more difficult/error
  prone/longer in non-functional languages.

  As for why Racket and not a different functional language like Haskell or Erlang or
  ML, it comes down to instructor preference.

  > How many hours should we be spending a week on this class?

  Cal Poly's guideline would be about 6 hours (plus the 3 hours of lab time). If you're
  spending way more than that on this class, come talk to me. If you're spending way
  less than that and it's working for you, that's great! If you're spending way less
  than that and it's not working for you, consider spending more time.

  > I notice that some of the things in the syllabus are specified towards Clements'
  > sections such as the lines about quizzes being on Wednesday, during which we don't
  > have class. Which other items on the syllabus should we expect to differ?

  Quiz dates, lab due dates, and the day of the midterm will be different, everything
  else will be the same. I'm currently planning on Thursdays for quizzes and probably
  Tuesdays for lab due dates, although the schedule isn't entirely finalized.

  > I want to make sure I forge good connections with my professors, what is the best
  > way to do this?

  Come to office hours! Ask questions!

- CSC 445

  > Are there any external sources/material that I can potentially use during my time
  > outside of class to learn the necessary material for me to succeed in class?

  Off hand, I don't know of something quick. Someone posted something on EdStem that I
  haven't vetted, but it looks like a good resource. Our book for the class (see the
  syllabus) also has some review material in Chapter 0.

  > Generally, how much time do you recommend spending on studying weekly for this
  > class?

  Cal Poly's guideline would be about 8 hours spent on studying/homework combined. If
  you're spending way more than that on this class, come talk to me. If you're spending
  way less than that and it's working for you, that's great! If you're spending way less
  than that and it's not working for you, try spending more time.

  > How does this course relate/compare to other CSC courses, such as Algorithms and
  > Discrete Structures? Is it similar, or are we entering a whole new area of
  > information?

  Discrete structures contains a lot of the mathematics that we will need in order to
  prove cool things about computation.

  Algorithms is very focused on taking problems that we can definitely solve with
  computers and figuring out how to solve them "well" (for some definition of well). The
  majority of this course will be focusing on problems (that we might be able to solve
  with computers) and figuring out if we can or can't actually solve them at all. The
  very end of the course will overlap a bit with the end of algorithms (P and NP related
  topics).

  > I would love to know the course structure and what to expect from the class. Also
  > what needs to be done to excel in the class.

  It'll be a math class! We'll be defining things, and then proving statements about
  those things. To excel, I would suggest making sure you come to class, ask questions
  when you have them, start the homework early, come to office hours with questions when
  you have them.

  > I would like to know what material we should be familiar with going into this class.

  I expect that you're familiar with the various styles of mathematical proofs (e.g.,
  direct, contraposition, contradiction, induction) and have exposure to various common
  mathematical objects (e.g., sets, graphs).

  > For lecture notes it says that the notes need to be posted by 6pm the day of the
  > lecture but lecture is 6:10pm to 8pm. When should we have it up in that case?

  Ah, that's what happens when I copy a syllabus from a different term. This has been
  updated to say 6pm the following day.

  > How many hours do you believe should be put into studying for this class? Should I
  > expect this class to be on par with a normal CS course worth of time, or should I
  > expect this to be one of my more time consuming classes?

  See above for full answer, tl;dr, about 8 hours per week.

  > I heard that it is very theory intensive, is that a major worry?

  I suppose that depends on what you worry about. I love the theory.

  > Will we go over the format for the notes?

  There's a LaTeX template in the discussion thread (and on the Syllabus). It should
  look roughly like that.

## Summer 2023

  > What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

  I'm pretty fond of coffee.

  > I'm curious how the class will be structured.

  We'll be doing math! A lot of math! Possibly more math that you wanted!

  > Would you share real live examples of related concepts?

  Historically, this is the origin of the field of computer science. Everything that
  comes after builds off of what we're going to be learning.

  Slightly more practically, we're going to discuss various computation problems that
  computers are unable to solve and would be a fool's errand to try to write code for.
  The most famous example of this is called the halting problem which we will prove
  cannot be solved by a computer.

  Towards the end of the class (time permitting), we'll talk about some concepts related
  to time complexity of algorithms.
